        </h3>
    
         
            <ol>
                <li>Turtles belong to one of the oldest reptile groups in the world, beating snakes, crocodiles and alligators!</li>
                <br>            
                <li>Just like your bones, a turtle’s shell is actually part of its skeleton. It’s made up of over 50 bones which include the turtle’s rib cage and spine.</li>
                <br>
                <li>They also have light, spongy bones that help them float.</li>
                <br>
                <li>These cold-blooded creatures have an incredibly long life span. The oldest ever recorded, named Tu”i Malila, of Tonga Island, passed away at the grand old age of 188!</li>
                <br>
                <li>Turtles don't have teeth. They use their beak-like mouth to grasp their food. This beak is made of keratin (the same stuff your fingernails are made of).</li>
                <br>
                <li>The first few years of a marine turtle’s life are known as the ‘lost years’. That’s because the time between when the hatchlings emerge until they return to coastal shallow waters to forage is incredibly difficult to study. The lost years they spend at sea – which can be up to 20 years – largely remain a mystery to us.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Turtles may sometimes look as if they're crying - but they're actually getting rid of excess salt (from swallowing salty seawater) through a 'salt excretion gland' near the corner of their eye. The salt excreted from this gland can have a salt concentration twice that of seawater.</li>
